    abstract = {Circuit Design for CMOS VLSI presents a field which has evolved from
                a highly specialized technique to the dominant silicon technology
                over a span of twenty-plus years.
                The field of CMOS integrated circuits has reached a level of maturity
                where it is now a mainstream technology for high-density digital system
                designs. Circuit Design for CMOS VLSI deals with circuit design in an
                integrated CMOS environment. Emphasis is placed on understanding the
                operation, performance, and design of basis digital circuits such as
                logic gates, latches, and adders. The topical outline and the level of
                presentation have been gauged such that the book should be of use to both
                students and practicing engineers.
                The presentation of material centers around the basic operational and
                design concepts, with circuit examples to reinforce the material.},
